# Home task (Task 2)

## Description

- Create package.json file and install react.

- Install and configure webpack & babel to get build artifact by running npm command.
- Set DEV and PROD build configuration. Use env variables, dev server, optimizations for PROD build.

- Donâ€™t use any React boilerplate (like create-react-app) for this task.

### Configure Linter

- Install linter to check JS files
- Choose one of the public presets (configs) with rules
- Fix all issues
- Install Husky + Lint-staged to run linters on pre-commit hook

## Configure TypeScript (optional)

Today most of the projects use TypeScript as a main language.
We highly encourage you to configure TypeScript for the project:

Install TypeScript package
Configure transpiling
Change your previous code (if you have any) to the new syntax
You can skip this step if you wish to use plain JavaScript instead.
But keep in mind that by skipping TypeScript you will miss important part of experience.
Discuss this with your mentor.
